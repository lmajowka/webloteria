## Features

- Bitcoin private key generation
- Bitcoin address derivation and verification
- Real-time processing statistics
- Visual feedback through console output
- Intuitive user interface

## How It Works

The application works by:
1. Generating random private keys
2. Deriving the corresponding Bitcoin addresses
3. Checking if any generated address matches the target address(es)
4. Displaying results and statistics in real-time

## Technical Details

This application is built using pure JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser. It leverages elliptic curve cryptography libraries to perform Bitcoin key operations. No data is sent to any server, ensuring your privacy and security.
